It's part of the larger OpenFEC project, and we think it's a very encouraging sign that this collaboration is going to improve access to a crucial information resource.\n",

It's difficult to know how a dataset might be used by a researcher, reporter, citizen or advocacy group, so it's important that government bodies release ALL of it in machine-readable bulk files to allow the fullest exploration of what's available and to give context to any given data point. The FEC has historically set an excellent example in making bulk data available. "

Even if you're technically skilled enough to load it into R or pandas, though, you may hit a barrier if the operations you want to carry out require that the data be loaded into memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, a bulk release may contain a lot of data that isn't relevant to a particular usecase or investigation. Let's say I want to look at contributions to House candidates who are Democrats in 2012. If I use the bulk release, I'm going to get a lot of data that's not interesting to me, including all of the contributions to non-candidate PACs, members of other parties, and contributions to presidential or senatorial candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling out exactly what you need usually requires loading everything into a database, setting up some indices, and running queries. True, there are some tools for working directly with CSV files, like the excellent [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.1/), but depending on your query, you again might run into memory issues. Good old \\*nix standbys `grep`, `cut`, `sed` and `awk` can also get you pretty far, if you're willing to hone your shell scripts.\n",

As long as the API supports it, you can formulate your query and retrieve it with confidence.

    "A certain level of legal and regulatory expertise is needed when calculating these sums, but might be out of scope for a developer that wants to add or explore some summary statistics from campaign finance, but for whom campaign finance is not the main focus of investigation. Maybe the focus is on projected vote share, and the campaign finance information is going to be added for context. In cases like that, it's useful to source the aggregate totals published by the FEC itself, and an API is a great way to deliver that data."

    "\n",
    "In fact, for some usecases, an API might obviate the need for a database altogether.  Imagine again the case of a website that shows some other, non-campaign-finance data, such as legislative activity or election results. If campaign finance data could be a helpful addition to that kind of app, the developer can avoid having to build a big addition onto their database by making client-side calls with javascript. The site, which may be backed by a large database, can deliver data in a web app, and then obtain FEC's aggregate totals or summary facts on-the-fly, allowing them to show up if and when the site's designers choose."

    "The group of developers working on OpenFEC includes two former Sunlight labs members. We couldn't be prouder of the work they've been doing during their time \"on the inside.\" It's unsurprising, though, that they've been effective at 18f and more specifically on the OpenFEC project. Lindsay Young developed our portal for accessing a live feed Foreign Agent Registration Act, and Alison Rowland was my predecessor as project lead on Influence Explorer. We miss them both, but we're very grateful for the hard work they and their team are putting into improving public access to campaign finance disclosure at the federal level."
