Even if you're technically skilled enough to load it into R or pandas, though, you may hit a barrier if the operations you want to carry out require that the data be loaded into memory. \n",

Let's say I want to look at contributions to House candidates who are Democrats in 2012. If I use the bulk release, I'm going to get a lot of data that's not interesting to me, including all of the contributions to non-candidate PACs, members of other parties, and contributions to presidential or senatorial candidates.\n",

Good old \\*nix standbys `grep`, `cut`, `sed` and `awk` can also get you pretty far, if you're willing to hone your shell scripts.\n",

In cases like that, it's useful to source the aggregate totals published by the FEC itself, and an API is a great way to deliver that data."

Imagine again the case of a website that shows some other, non-campaign-finance data, such as legislative activity or election results. If campaign finance data could be a helpful addition to that kind of app, the developer can avoid having to build a big addition onto their database by making client-side calls with javascript. The site, which may be backed by a large database, can deliver data in a web app, and then obtain FEC's aggregate totals or summary facts on-the-fly, allowing them to show up if and when the site's designers choose."

    "  1. **Search By Name** - Nearly every question that can be answered with FEC data requires knowing the unique identifiers that FEC has assigned to the entities involved. The search endpoints make acquiring these identifiers straightforward.\n",
    "  2. **Candidate and Committee Details** - Armed with the right identifiers, one can access a lot of important information about any candidate or committee, including location information, FEC designations, and the entity's history.\n",
    "  3. **Financial Reports** - For each committee, you can obtain the top-line numbers describing contributions, reciepts, expenditures and loans. These are sourced from the committee's periodically-filed financial reports. These come complete with links to the PDF (shudder) of the original filing.\n",
    "  4. **Per-Cycle Committee Summaries** - In addition to the individual reports' numbers, the API also makes available top-line numbers aggregated on a per-cycle basis.\n",
    "  \n",

    "While we were excited to see the progress made so far, there's a few things we'd really like to see added to the API.\n",

There is a tremendous amount of useful information that is contained in these line items. Without an endpoint for itemized transactions, the bulk data and live feeds still offer much that the API does not. *NOTE: Thanks to the OpenFEC team's [in-the-open development](https://github.com/18F/openFEC) on Github, there's [evidence](https://github.com/18F/openFEC/blob/2022c0a965f878e0c62521d321104a52c9e500e5/webservices/rest.py#L178-L194) that this is on the way!*\n",
    "  2. **Per-Contributor/Per-Recipient Aggregates** - Campaign finance data is essentially the description of the relationships between contributors and their recipients. Endpoints are needed that list (a) the per-contributor, per-cycle aggregate totals of reciepts and (b) the per-recipient, per-cycle aggregate totals of disbursements. It's unfortunate that, given the state of disclosure, these can only include PAC-to-candidate and PAC-to-PAC transactions, but they're very useful nonetheless.\n",
    "  3. **Independent Expenditure Aggregates** - In a world strongly influenced by the behavior of Independent-Expenditure Only PACs (aka Super PACs), it's very important to be able to ask two questions: (a) for a given Super PAC, who have they spent the most money targeting negatively/positively? and (b) for a given candidate, who has spent the most targeting them negatively/positively? This data is available from FEC, but isn't an endpoint, yet."
